Here you can find a mostly up-to-date, chronologically sorted list of my publications. By clicking on the publication title, you should typically be able to access the abstract of the respective work, my own copy of the pdf, slides (if there was a talk and if I was the one giving it), and a link to the source code/artifacts of the project that produced the respective publication. You can also find my articles on <a href="{{site.author.googlescholar}}">my Google Scholar profile</a>.</div>
