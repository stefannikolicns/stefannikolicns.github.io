I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

University of Novi Sad is also my alma mater, where I completed my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In the meantime, I did my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL, Switzerland, under the guidance of Professor Paolo Ienne and I spent some time at Xilinx (now AMD), working on FPGA architecture and CAD under Chirag Ravishankar and Dinesh Gaitonde.

You can see my detailed CV [[here]](http://stefannikolicns.github.io/files/snikolic_cv.pdf).

Research
======
My research interests primarily lie in reconfigurable computing and electronic design automation, with a particular emphasis on FPGA architecture and design of CAD algorithms required to efficiently map user circuits on such new FPGAs. Besides being fascinated by reconfigurable computing, I am also very interested in various CAD problems in general. 

If you find any of the problems that I have worked on interesting and you would like to work with me, don't hesitate to reach out at stefan.nikolic at dmi.uns.ac.rs.

To se posebno odnosi na studente i kolege iz Srbije i ostalih zemalja gde se lako razumemo :).
