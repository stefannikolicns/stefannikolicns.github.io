I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. 

University of Novi Sad is also my alma mater, where I completed my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In the meantime, I did my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL, Switzerland, under the guidance of Professor Paolo Ienne and I spent some time at Xilinx (now AMD), working on FPGA architecture and CAD under Chirag Ravishankar and Dinesh Gaitonde.

Research
======
My research interests primarily lie in reconfigurable computing and electronic design automation, with a particular emphasis on FPGA architecture and design of CAD algorithms required to efficiently map user circuits on such new FPGAs. Besides being fascinated by reconfigurable computing, I am also very interested in various CAD problems in general. 

If you find any of the problems that I have worked on interesting and you would like to work with me, don't hesitate to reach out at stefan.nikolic at dmi.uns.ac.rs.

To se posebno odnosi na studente i kolege iz Srbije i ostalih zemalja gde se lako razumemo :).
