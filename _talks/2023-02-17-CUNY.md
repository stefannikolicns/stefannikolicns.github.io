**Abstract** Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are the most popular platform for reconfigurable computing. As such, they provide an appealing way to implement custom hardware, especially for acceleraing rapidly evolving tasks like those found in machine learning inference. Despite being around for almost four decades, there are still many unknowns in designing the FPGA architectures themselves; this is paricularly tue for their programmable interconnect.

In this talk, after reviewing the most fundamental concepts of reconfigurable computing, I will present several recently developed algorithms for automating the design of programmable interconnect in FPGAs. I will also comment on some problems in this field that remain open and suggest some possibilities for resolving them in the future.
