**Abstract** Four years ago, when the news of AMD acquiring Xilinx first became
public, FPGAs were a rather hot topic. New reconfigurable chips being
rolled out in the back-then latest fabrication technologies were
promising such things as dramatic performance boosts in AI inference
and fundamentally more secure hardware. Yet, in the second quarter of
2024, AMD reported a 41% drop in year over year revenue of its
embedded division into which Xilinx was incorporated. This is in stark
contrast with GPUs which were part of similar AI-related promises. Two
major reasons for deflated expectations from FPGAs are 1) that FPGAs
failed to transition to newer technology nodes in the four years that
have passed, thus losing much of the competitive edge that they used
to have for most of the XXI century and 2) that attempting to use an
FPGA can still be a frustrating experience for domain experts.
